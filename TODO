TODO's:

* Exhaustive set of unit-tests (Robolectric) and functional tests (Robotium)
* Use an ORM for data-access (ActiveAndroid?)
* UI-cleanup (theming, externalizing all strings, contact-photos)
* Tests for the background services
* Build automation (Ant)
* Support for continuous integration (Hudson?)
* Move towards a 'release-candidate' (signing, licenses, api-keys, etc)
