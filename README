Proxime v1.0

What is it?
-----------

Proxime is an application that runs on the Android platform. Any user that 
installs this app on their mobile device can setup notifications on reaching 
a particular destination. The user can pick a destination off a map, or search 
for a particular address. The user can choose to notify herself, or one of her 
contacts. Essentially, Proxime lets you set up geo-alerts for you and your 
loved ones.
